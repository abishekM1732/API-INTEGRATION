*DESCRIPTION*:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was developed as part of CODTECH Internship – Task 1, where the primary objective was to build a fully responsive webpage capable of fetching, processing, and displaying data from a public API. The task focuses on understanding how modern web applications interact with external data sources, handle asynchronous operations, and provide a seamless user experience. To achieve this, the application enables users to search for any city worldwide and instantly retrieve real-time weather information along with the latest news updates related to that specific location.

The weather information is sourced from the Open-Meteo API, which offers accurate details such as temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and weather codes—all without requiring any API key. This makes the integration lightweight and beginner-friendly while still providing reliable, real-time data. For news updates, the application uses the Google News RSS feed, allowing it to fetch headlines for the searched location. The news data is accessed through the AllOrigins API, a public CORS proxy that ensures the RSS feed can be fetched securely and without browser restrictions. This combination of APIs demonstrates how multiple data sources can be merged into a single user interface to provide meaningful, location-based insights.

The interface is intentionally designed to be clean, modern, and visually appealing, using a dark-themed glass UI style to improve readability and user engagement. It is fully responsive, ensuring smooth usage on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, maintaining consistent spacing, typography, and structure. Special attention was given to user experience details such as smooth scrolling, clear error messages, loading states, and intuitive input behavior to make the application feel polished and professional.

From a technical standpoint, the project focuses on practical skills such as working with REST APIs, parsing RSS data, manipulating the DOM dynamically, and handling network errors gracefully. It also emphasizes writing clean, readable code using vanilla JavaScript without relying on external frameworks. This approach reinforces core web development skills while still delivering a functional and visually appealing final product.

Overall, this project successfully fulfills the requirements of Task 1 by demonstrating API integration, dynamic content rendering, UI responsiveness, and practical problem-solving. It also showcases how multiple services can be combined to create a single, unified user experience focused on real-time information.
