*DESCRIPTION*:<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was developed as part of CODTECH Internship – Task 1, where the primary objective was to design and implement a fully responsive webpage capable of fetching, processing, and dynamically displaying data obtained from a public API. The core intention behind this task is to build familiarity with external data sources, understand how APIs are integrated into real-world applications, and gain hands-on experience with asynchronous operations using JavaScript. Developing this project also provides a strong foundation in writing clean, maintainable front-end code and organizing it in a way that ensures readability and scalability.

The application enables users to search for any city worldwide and instantly retrieve real-time weather information as well as current news headlines related to that specific location. The weather data is obtained from the Open-Meteo API, which delivers highly accurate information including temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and weather codes—all without requiring authentication or API keys. This makes the integration simple and efficient, especially for beginners or academic-level projects.

To complement the weather information, the application also displays relevant news articles for the searched city. This is achieved using Google News RSS, a widely accessible feed that provides trending headlines and updates. Since browsers restrict direct RSS fetching due to CORS limitations, the AllOrigins API is used as a secure CORS proxy to safely fetch the RSS content. Together, these APIs demonstrate how multiple independent services can be combined to enhance the overall informational value of a web application.

The UI is built using a modern dark-themed glass interface, focusing on readability, minimalism, and visual appeal. The entire layout is responsive, ensuring seamless performance across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Additional UX improvements—such as smooth transitions, consistent spacing, proper error handling, and intuitive user input behavior—greatly improve the professionalism and polish of the application.

From a technical perspective, the project highlights key concepts such as working with REST APIs, parsing JSON and RSS/XML data, dynamically updating the DOM, and handling asynchronous programming with async/await. It also demonstrates best practices like separating concerns, using clean layout structures, and avoiding unnecessary libraries, making the project suitable for both learning and demonstration purposes.

Overall, this project fulfills all requirements of Task 1 by showcasing API integration, responsive UI design, real-time data rendering, and strong full-stack development fundamentals. It also reflects practical problem-solving, creativity, and technical clarity—skills essential for modern web development.
